justifrusti's Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio feel free to look around.

the a* pathfinding was made using the a* pathfinding tutorial from this kind programmer: https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague
there is a full understanding of what i wrote and i can explain all the parts thats why i put it in my portfolio.

the procedual landmass generation was made using the procedual landmass generation tutorial from this kind programmer: https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague
there is a full understanding of what i wrote and i can explain all the parts thats why i put it in my portfolio.

the poisson disc sampling was made using this research paper made by Robert Braidson: https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph07-poissondisk.pdf

the Risk of Rain 2 - Spawning and Scaling is made using these RoR2 wiki pages as reference: 
- https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Difficulty
- https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Directors

the Boids were made using these research papers/resources:
- Craig W. Reynolds: Flocks, Herds and Schools: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt/siggraph97-course/cwr87/
- Points on a sphere: https://stackoverflow.com/a/44164075

Note: The Marching cubes algorithm passed in with the boids is to simulate a sea like environment in the Unity editor,
for a clearer and cleaner project take a look at the marching cubes entry.

the Marching Cubes were made using these research papers/resources:
- Paul Bourke: Polygonising a scalar field: http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/
- Ryan Geiss {NVIDIA Corporation}: Generating Complex Procedural Terrains using the GPU: https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-i-geometry/chapter-1-generating-complex-procedural-terrains-using-gpu
- William E. Lorensen/Harvey E. Cline: Marching Cubes: A High Resolution 3D Surface Construction Algorithm: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/meshpapers/LorensenCline.pdf

the Raymarching was made using these reaserch papers/resources:
- Inigo Quilez: Distance Functions: https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/
- Jamie Wong: Ray marching and signed Distance functions: https://jamie-wong.com/2016/07/15/ray-marching-signed-distance-functions/#the-raymarching-algorithm
- Inigo Quilez: Smooth Minimum: https://iquilezles.org/articles/smin/
- Syntopia: Distance Estimated 3D Fractals (V): The Mandelbulb & Different DE Approximations: http://blog.hvidtfeldts.net/index.php/2011/09/distance-estimated-3d-fractals-v-the-mandelbulb-different-de-approximations/
